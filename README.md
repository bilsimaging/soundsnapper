## 🧠 Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration

**Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** ("nano banana" technology) is SoundSnapper's intelligent core, accessed via Fal AI's `fal-ai/gemini-25-flash-image/edit` endpoint.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **🔍 Scene Understanding** - Recognizes objects, materials, environments, and context
- **🎨 Style Generation** - Creates artistic transformations (Anime, Cyberpunk, Watercolor)
- **🧠 Smart Context** - Provides rich descriptions for audio generation

**The Magic Flow:**
1. Photo captured → Gemini analyzes visual elements
2. Gemini generates artistic style variants via Fal AI
3. Scene understanding informs ElevenLabs audio creation
4. Result: Perfectly matched visual + audio experience

Gemini 2.5 Flash is the "brain" that makes everything possible - understanding your photos and transforming them into creative art while providing context for matching soundscapes. Without nano banana technology, SoundSnapper couldn't bridge the gap between visual input and meaningful audio-visual output.
